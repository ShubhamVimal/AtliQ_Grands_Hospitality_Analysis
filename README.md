## 📝 Overview
AtliQ Grands has served the luxury segment for 20+ years, but recent competition and poor decision-making have impacted their market position. To solve this, they adopted **Business & Data Intelligence** and partnered with a third-party analytics provider to turn historical data into actionable insights.

## 🎯 Project Goal

- Track key metrics like revenue, occupancy, and booking trends  
- Analyze performance at platform and property levels  
- Monitor monthly and weekly changes  
- Support smarter, data-driven decisions to regain market share
